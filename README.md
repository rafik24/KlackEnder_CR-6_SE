# KlackEnder_CR-6_SE
KlackEnder Rev_2 adapted to work on a Creality CR-6 SE. 

### What is this about?

Adaptation of the [KlackEnder](https://github.com/kevinakasam/KlackEnder-Probe/)/[Klicky](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe)/[Quickdraw](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe) Probe for the Ender 3 and comparable Creality printers.
### Why ?

Since there was no version for the CR-6 SE, I used Kevin's CAD files and adapted them toghether with scripts to my stock CR-6 SE.
